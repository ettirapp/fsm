processing FSM definition file testing_files/test1.fsm
FSM has 16 transitions
processing FSM inputs file testing_files/test1.inputs
	at step 0, input a transitions FSM from state 0 to state 1
	at step 1, input a transitions FSM from state 1 to state 0
	at step 2, input a transitions FSM from state 0 to state 1
	at step 3, input a transitions FSM from state 1 to state 0
	at step 4, input b transitions FSM from state 0 to state 1
	at step 5, input c transitions FSM from state 1 to state 2
	at step 6, input b transitions FSM from state 2 to state 1
	at step 7, input c transitions FSM from state 1 to state 2
after 8 steps, state machine finished successfully at state 2
